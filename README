Cargo is usually shipped with Rust.

Build:

2. cd mod2abc
3. cargo build --release

Usage:
1. Create a .mod file in Protracker.
Only the instrument numbers will be used.
2. Convert the .mod file using
mod2abc --in <filename> --out song.s
3. Edit instruments.s to your liking.
One instrument definition per instrument used in the .mod file
4. Create a program for Luxor ABC80 and include tracker.s
Tracker.s will include instruments.s and song.s.
5. In the program, 
call tracker_init at initialization and
call tracker_play each vertical blanking
6. Profit!

Bonus:
When tracker_row_countdown = song_speed then the replay routine just
started playing the next row.
When tracker_row_countdown = 0 then the replay routine will start a 
new row next frame.
When tracker_pattern_countdown = TRACKER_PATTERN_SIZE then the replay
routine just started playing a new pattern.
When tracker_pattern_countdown = 0 then the replay routine will start a 
new pattern next frame.
